📝 Overview
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a serious liver disorder characterized by:
✅ Fat accumulation in the liver
✅ Inflammation & hepatocellular injury
✅ Increased risk of cirrhosis & liver cancer

🚀 Our goal: Identify putative disease genes & explore drug repurposing using network-based algorithms.

🎯 Project Objectives
🔬 Disease Gene Identification:
✅ Leverage Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks
✅ Use DIAMOnD, DIAble, and Diffusion algorithms
✅ Analyze multi-omics data (proteomics & genomics)

💊 Drug Repurposing Approach:
✅ Screen FDA-approved drugs
✅ Identify potential therapeutic candidates
✅ Accelerate the drug discovery process

🛠 Methodology & Workflow
📥 Step 1: Data Collection
📌 BioGRID: PPI Network 🧬
📌 DisGeNET: Gene-Disease Associations (C2711227)

🕸 Step 2: Network Construction
📌 Build PPI Network from BioGRID
📌 Filter for human physical interactions
📌 Identify the Largest Connected Component (LCC)

🧪 Step 3: Disease Gene Identification
📌 Apply DIAMOnD, DIAble, and Diffusion algorithms
📌 Identify genes involved in NASH pathogenesis

💊 Step 4: Drug Repurposing
📌 Map putative genes to existing drugs
📌 Use network-based drug screening
📌 Identify potential NASH treatments

🏗 Tech Stack & Tools
🖥 Programming Language: Python 🐍
📚 Libraries: pandas, numpy, networkx, matplotlib, seaborn
🗄 Databases: BioGRID, DisGeNET
